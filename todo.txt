*** DONE the shield and the cannon share the same battery
    - getting hit and firing uses the battery
    - the battery slowly discharges over time? sounds a little too
      complicated;
    - moving uses a bit of battery?
    - getting hit on an empty battery will kill you
    - both players share the same battery
